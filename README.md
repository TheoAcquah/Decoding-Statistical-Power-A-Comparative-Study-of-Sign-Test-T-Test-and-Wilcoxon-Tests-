# Decoding Statistical Power: A-Comparative-Study-of-Sign-Test||T-Test-and-Wilcoxon-Tests

This project, titled "Empirical Power For The Sign-Test, T-test, and The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test," by Acquah Theophilus B.K., presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of three statistical tests: the sign-test, the t-test, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The project is focused on assessing the power of these tests under different scenarios, providing a vital resource for researchers and statisticians involved in hypothesis testing. The study involves generating random samples from symmetric distributions, including uniform, normal, and double exponential distributions, each standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. The empirical power of each test is computed for sample sizes of 10, 15, and 20.

The methodology incorporates a detailed setup using R programming, involving packages like pwr, coin, VGAM, dplyr, tidyr, and knitr. The project explores the statistical properties of the tests under different parameters and distributions, using both theoretical and simulated approaches to calculate their power. The results are meticulously documented in tables, showcasing the empirical power (multiplied by 1000) for each distribution and test. This analysis not only provides insights into the effectiveness of these statistical tests but also serves as a practical guide for applying these methods in various research settings. The project's significance lies in its detailed approach, providing an essential reference for understanding and implementing these fundamental statistical tests in empirical research.
